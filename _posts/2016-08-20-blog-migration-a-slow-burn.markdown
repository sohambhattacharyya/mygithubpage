Alright. I have now added the url for this site to my résumé and everywhere. Kinda scary. The site feels incomplete, and I am still feeling my way through putting content together. Also, I was using WordPress with a pre-fab template. Now I am using [Jekyll][jekyll] on my self-hosted site, as I am getting used to [Markdown][markdown] at the same time. This is something awe-inspiring (not that the template [Karuna][karuna] was not good. But I really wanted more breathing room...)

If you followed a link here, more will come soon. I need to finish the _Basic DSP with MATLAB_ series, both for "blogging practice" and because it will assist me in keeping my cognitive memory of computing at its apex.

Thanks for dropping by. Come back and see how things are progressing. I am eager to begin exploring some actual topics, but wanted to get the pieces in place first, because, well, I just can't stand to make a dippy of myself!
