Site construction is in progress (in case you have accidentally landed on this page). Experimenting with layout and formatting. The fine tuning. I have integrated some of my social accounts. And it is quite close to be up and running.

Well, the goal for this site will be to provide quality, original content targeting anyone interested in programming, electronics, software development, computers, engineering and likely a few other topics about which I am obsessed. I will also use this site to showcase some of my projects and to keep a track of my learning experience which will slip into the content stream from time to time. Think music.

While this site is currently viewable on the web, and most likely will appear in certain search results, I am not yet actively promoting it, since I am not yet providing content of any real value. My focus is on creating the site structure. I hope to offer up all sorts of scintillating thoughts, reflections, and wisdom soon, however, so please check back!
